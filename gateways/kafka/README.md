# Kafka gateway (`iggy-gateway-kafka`)

Foundation layer for [apache/iggy#3421](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3421): a TCP listener on the Kafka wire port that decodes requests, validates scoped API keys and versions, and returns stub responses.

> **Stub warning:** no API persists or reads real data yet. Produce, Fetch, and ListOffsets return retriable `NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER` (6) so clients keep data locally / retry elsewhere instead of trusting a fake success. CreateTopics does **not** create topics; valid requests return `NOT_CONTROLLER` (41). Metadata still reports requested topics as unknown. Persistence lands with the Iggy bridge (see [docs/SCOPE.md](docs/SCOPE.md)).

## Run

```bash
cargo run -p iggy-gateway-kafka
```

Default bind: `127.0.0.1:9093`. Environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IGGY_KAFKA_BIND_ADDR` | `127.0.0.1:9093` | TCP address to listen on |
| `IGGY_KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST` | bind IP | Hostname/IP clients use to reach this broker (required when binding to `0.0.0.0`/`::`) |
| `IGGY_KAFKA_ADVERTISED_PORT` | bind port | Port advertised in Metadata responses |
| `IGGY_KAFKA_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `1024` | Maximum concurrent connections before new ones are rejected |
| `IGGY_KAFKA_MAX_FRAME_SIZE` | `8388608` | Maximum accepted request frame size in bytes |
| `IGGY_KAFKA_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `600` | Seconds a connection may sit idle before the next frame's length prefix arrives |
| `IGGY_KAFKA_READ_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `15` | Seconds allowed to read a frame body once its length prefix arrives |
| `IGGY_KAFKA_WRITE_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `10` | Seconds allowed to write a response frame |
| `IGGY_KAFKA_SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_SECS` | `25` | Seconds graceful shutdown waits for in-flight connections before abandoning them |

## Test

```bash
cargo test -p iggy-gateway-kafka
```

See [docs/TEST_SUITE.md](docs/TEST_SUITE.md) for the full suite catalog (`cargo test -p iggy-gateway-kafka -- --list` for the exact current test names - the count has drifted out of sync with the actual suites before, so it isn't pinned here).

Some `api_handler_tests`, `server_e2e_tests`, and `version_firewall_tests` cases require wire fixtures under `tools/kafka-tool/kafka_messages/` (gitignored locally; CI generates them via `scripts/ci-wire-fixtures.sh`):

```bash
./gateways/kafka/scripts/ci-wire-fixtures.sh generate
cargo test -p iggy-gateway-kafka
./gateways/kafka/scripts/ci-wire-fixtures.sh cleanup   # optional
```

Or generate only the keys the tests need:

```bash
for key in 0 1 2 19; do
  cargo run -p kafka-message-gen -- generate \
    --output gateways/kafka/tools/kafka-tool/kafka_messages \
    --api-key "$key"
done
```

## Manual testing

Before check-in, run the procedure in [docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md](docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md) (smoke, version firewall, kcat, adversarial cases).

## Scoped APIs

See [docs/SCOPE.md](docs/SCOPE.md) for [#3421](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3421) deliverables, supported API key/version table, and post-foundation TODO backlog.

## Iggy bridge ([#3533](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3533))

`src/bridge/` is the SDK integration layer: connects to Iggy, maps Kafka topics to Iggy
streams/topics, provisions them on demand, and looks up high watermarks (one or many partitions of
a topic per call) for `ListOffsets`.
**Not wired into the live Produce/Fetch dispatch path yet** - that lands with
[#3535](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3535)/[#3536](https://github.com/apache/iggy/issues/3536).
Exercised today by `bridge`'s own unit tests and `tests/bridge_iggy_integration_tests.rs` (spawns a
real `iggy-server`).

### Connection config

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IGGY_KAFKA_IGGY_ADDR` | `127.0.0.1:8090` | Address of the Iggy server to bridge to |
| `IGGY_KAFKA_IGGY_USERNAME` | `iggy` | Iggy username |
| `IGGY_KAFKA_IGGY_PASSWORD` | none - **required** | Iggy password. No default: `iggy-server` only uses the well-known `iggy`/`iggy` root credentials when started with `--with-default-root-credentials` (dev-only); otherwise it generates a random password, so a hardcoded default here could never be right and would invite running as root unnoticed |
| `IGGY_KAFKA_IGGY_STREAM` | `kafka` | Default Iggy stream for a Kafka topic with no explicit mapping override |
| `IGGY_KAFKA_TOPIC_MAP_PATH` | unset | Path to a topic-mapping TOML file (see below); omit to use only the default rule |

The initial connect retries a fixed, bounded number of times (`RECONNECTION_RETRIES = 3`, not the
Iggy SDK client's own default of unlimited retries, one dial per second, forever), and the whole
attempt - retries included - is capped at `CONNECT_TIMEOUT` (15s) wall-clock, so `IggyBridge::connect`
fails in bounded time whether the address refuses the connection or silently drops it, instead of
blocking the calling task indefinitely. Every other bridge call (`ensure_stream_and_topic`,
`high_watermark(s)`, `close`) carries its own `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` (same 15s bound) for the same
reason: the SDK reconnects internally, mid-call, on a transport error, through the same
undead-lined dial path - a bridge call made well after the initial connect can still hit this if
Iggy becomes unreachable later. See `IggyBridge`'s own doc comment (its rustdoc is private, so
this isn't a followable link outside the crate - read the source at `src/bridge/iggy_bridge.rs`).

### Topic mapping

Default rule, no config file needed: a Kafka topic `orders` maps to Iggy stream
`IGGY_KAFKA_IGGY_STREAM` (default `kafka`), topic `orders` - the Kafka topic name carries over
unchanged. Override specific topics with a TOML file:

```toml
default_stream = "kafka"

[topics.orders]
stream = "billing"
topic = "orders_v2"

# A Kafka topic name containing dots needs the key quoted, or TOML parses it as nested
# tables ([topics.org] containing [apache] containing [kafka]) instead of one topic named
# "org.apache.kafka.events".
[topics."org.apache.kafka.events"]
stream = "billing"
topic = "kafka_events"
```

Point `IGGY_KAFKA_TOPIC_MAP_PATH` at the file to load it; topics not listed under `[topics.*]`
still fall back to the default rule.

`default_stream` is required in a map file - it has no `#[serde(default)]`, unlike `topics` -
so an override-only file with no `default_stream` key fails to load rather than falling back to
`kafka`. When both `IGGY_KAFKA_TOPIC_MAP_PATH` and `IGGY_KAFKA_IGGY_STREAM` are set, the file's own
`default_stream` always wins and the env var is ignored entirely: a TOML file is a complete mapping
document, not an overlay on top of the env var.

### Provisioning and idempotency

`ensure_stream_and_topic(kafka_topic, partition_count)` creates the mapped Iggy stream and topic
if either is missing. Idempotent when repeated with the *same* `partition_count`: a no-op if both
already exist with that count, and a `NameAlreadyExists` race against a concurrent caller creating
the same stream/topic is treated as success, not an error - the goal is "it exists," not "this
call created it." A *different* `partition_count` against an already-existing topic returns
`BridgeError::PartitionCountMismatch` rather than silently keeping the old count or growing it -
two concurrent callers requesting different counts for the same topic must not both see success.

Topics created this way have **no message expiry** - Iggy's own server default, not Kafka's 7-day
default. Nothing is bounding retention until it's configured explicitly (Iggy's own topic options,
outside this bridge today); repointing a Kafka app that assumes bounded retention onto this bridge
will accumulate data indefinitely unless you set that up yourself.

They also use Iggy's default **durability**, `Durability::Replicated` - quorum commit without an
additional stable-storage barrier, with the disk write itself threshold-gated (flushed at 1024
messages or 1 MiB of unflushed data, whichever comes first). Kafka's own defaults take the same
posture, so this isn't a wrong choice, but on a single node both can lose an acked write to a power
cut before that threshold is reached - worth knowing rather than discovering later.

### Concurrency ceiling

One `IggyBridge` (one `IggyClient`) is meant to serve every Kafka connection this gateway handles,
and the Iggy SDK's TCP transport is lockstep - one request in flight per client, its stream mutex
held across write, flush, and read. Every concurrent Kafka connection ends up serialized behind
whichever single Iggy request is in flight; the Kafka side's own connection limit
(`IGGY_KAFKA_MAX_CONNECTIONS`) does nothing to relieve this. No connection pooling exists yet - it
is a known gap to address before `#3535`/`#3536` put this on a hot path, not a design decision to
rely on.

### Error mapping

`BridgeError::to_kafka_error_code()` maps Iggy failures to Kafka wire error codes:

- Stream/topic/partition not found → `UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION` (3)
- A rejected *permission* (`Unauthorized`) → `TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED` (29) - a real,
  fixable-by-the-Kafka-operator ACL problem
- A rejected *login* (the bridge's own `IGGY_KAFKA_IGGY_USERNAME`/`_PASSWORD` are wrong) →
  `UNKNOWN_SERVER_ERROR` (-1), deliberately **not** 29 - the Kafka client can't fix a bridge-side
  credential misconfiguration, and blaming its own ACLs for one is worse than an unexplained
  fatal error
- Connection-shaped failures → `NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER` (6, the same retriable code the
  foundation's own stubs send, so a client backs off and retries)
- An Iggy commit whose outcome is genuinely unknown (`TransientNotCommitted`) →
  `REQUEST_TIMED_OUT` (7) - retriable in real Kafka too, chosen because it's what a real broker
  sends for the same shape of failure, not to make a client stop retrying
- An invalid Kafka-side topic name (empty, whitespace-padded, oversized, illegal characters) →
  `INVALID_TOPIC_EXCEPTION` (17), checked before any Iggy call is made
- `PartitionCountMismatch` → `TOPIC_ALREADY_EXISTS` (36, not `INVALID_PARTITIONS` - that code's
  own text is "below 1", a different condition)
- Anything else → `UNKNOWN_SERVER_ERROR` (-1)
